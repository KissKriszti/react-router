# react-router

1. Landing
Create a landing page that the user encounters first when they reach the website. The page is built using a layout that serves as the base for all the subpages. The layout contains the header and footer. The header is the navigation tool. It must contains all links for the web application (home, about, and contact). The footer must contain the information that the page is an example project. The page content does not need to be more than a title that describes the page.
Starting the application with the npm start command displays a landing page with a header and footer opening.
The / route redirects to a page with a title saying This is the home page in the content section of the page.
The header contains a link to the / route, titled Home; a link to the /about route, titled About, and a link to the /contacts route, titled Contacts.
The footer contains the phrase This is an example project for practicing React routing.

2. About page
Create an About page. Build the page using the same layout as the landing page. The page must contain the same header and the same footer as the landing page. There must be a title on the page.
The /about route redirects to a page with the same header and footer as the landing page.
The page contains the title This is the about page.

3. Contacts page
Create a Contacts page. Build the page using the same layout as the landing page. The page must contain the same header and the same footer as the landing page. There must be a title on the page.
The /contacts redirects to a page with the same header and footer as the landing page.
The page contains a title This is the contacts page
